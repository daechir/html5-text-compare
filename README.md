## Purpose
HTML5 Text Compare is a minimal diffing utility for offline or local usage. <br/>
Currently this project is in ALPHA and is very quirky.


## Alpha Limitations
* Largely dissimilar files tend to have issues.
* Potential oversight in the CompareInequal logic which may cause specific lines to fall into the third itteration and return blank, even though they aren't, unintentionally.


## Current usage recommendations
HTML5 Text Compare works best with documents that have a small to a medium difference between the two.
If a few lines are removed, moved or modified it should be fairly accurate.
